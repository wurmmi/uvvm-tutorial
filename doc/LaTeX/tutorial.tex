\section{Tutorial}

This tutorial guides you through the example project that was developed.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Device Under Verification (DUV)}

The Device Under Verification (DUV) is a very basic LED driver, that has some additional accessible memory inside. The interface this memory uses, is compile-time configurable between an AXIlite, or an Avalon MM protocol.

\subsection{Testbench Architecture}

The architecture of the demo testbench is shown in the block diagram below.

\includepicture[0.8][0]{Testbench Block Diagram}{img/draw-io/tb-architecture}

The testbench instantiates a test harness and runs the actual test sequences. It further generates clock and reset signals for the DUV.
The test harness instantiates several VVCs and the DUV. Dotted lines in the block diagram represent connections, that exist within the UVVM framework and don't need to be connected explicitly.

\subsection{Hands-On}

At this point, we have enough information and are ready to start working with the example project.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Project environment}

Let's start with getting to know the projects' environment setup. \\
In this part we will compile the UVVM library and the DUV, and run the simulation of our first example testbench!

\begin{enumerate}
      \item Open the example-tb folder in the repository.
            You will find a Makefile, that's used to simplify the usage of this project. It builds an abstraction layer to the underlaying ModelSim commands.
      \item \texttt{make help} is your friend. \\
            It shows all the actions, that this project provides.
      \item Call \texttt{make ip}. \\
            This compiles all the VHDL files, that belong to the DUV.\\
            Call this target, whenever your DUVs RTL code changed and you want to simulate it.
      \item Call \texttt{make uvvm}. \\
            This compiles several required components of the UVVM library. \\
            That only needs to be done once.
      \item Call \texttt{make test}. \\
            This compiles the testbench files and runs the simulation.
      \item Read through the log that was generated.\\
            The console output was also logged into \href{example-tb/build/log/sim\_testbench.log}{a log file}\footnote{example-tb/build/log/sim\_testbench.log}.
\end{enumerate}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Read through the AXI test sequence}

The DUV includes a memory that can be accessed through an AXI memory mapped interface. In this part, we will read through the existing AXI test sequence code.

\begin{enumerate}
      \item Open the \href{../../example-tb/src/tb/sequences/axi\_reg\_seq\_pkg.vhd} {AXI register test sequence file}\footnote{example-tb/src/tb/sequences/axi\_reg\_seq\_pkg.vhd}.
      \item Check out the main AXI VVC functions.
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item \texttt{axilite\_write()}\\
                        Writes data to a given address.\\
                        This function is non-blocking. It schedules the action in the UVVM sequencer queue.
                  \item \texttt{axilite\_check()}\\
                        Reads data from a given address and compares with the given value.\\
                        This function is non-blocking. It schedules the action in the UVVM sequencer queue.
                  \item \texttt{await\_completion()}\\
                        This function waits on a given VVC to complete its action queue. In case the VVC exceeds the given timeout, an error is raised.\\
            \end{itemize}
      \item Try to write a register that is read-only.
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item Writing to a read-only register is not allowed. Thus, we expect the call \texttt{axilite\_write()} to fail and raise a \texttt{TB\_FAILURE}.
                  \item We need to tell UVVM that we are expecting this failure. By default, the testbench execution is stopped after the occurance of a single failure.
                  \item Two functions need to be called to set expected failures. \\These are \texttt{increment\_expected\_alerts()} and \texttt{set\_alert\_stop\_limit()}.
                  \item At the end of the testbench execution log, there is a report in the form of a table, that shows the number of alerts that occurred during the simulation run. See, that the number of \textit{expected} alerts matches the number of \textit{regarded} alerts. (The latter should better be called \textit{occured} in my opinion...).\\
                        However, this means that writing to the read-only register failed as expected, and our test case was successful.
            \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Write a memory test sequence}

In this part, we will write a test sequence that verifies the correct functionality of this memory.

\begin{enumerate}
      \item Open the \href{../../example-tb/src/tb/sequences/axi\_reg\_seq\_pkg.vhd} {AXI register test sequence file}\footnote{example-tb/src/tb/sequences/axi\_reg\_seq\_pkg.vhd}.
      \item Scroll to the end of the file, where you will find a ``TODO'' section.
      \item Write a test sequence, that runs a write-read test on all registers of the internal memory. \\
            \\
            For information about the memory structure, look at the \href{example-tb/src/include/blinkylight.h}{C include file}\footnote{example-tb/src/include/blinkylight.h}.\\
            Furthermore, taking a look at the already existing test sequence for the Avalon MM interface is a good point to begin with. Find it in the \href{example-tb/src/tb/sequences/av\_mm\_reg\_seq\_pkg.vhd}{Avalon MM test sequence file}\footnote{example-tb/src/tb/sequences/av\_mm\_reg\_seq\_pkg.vhd}.

      \item Run the test sequence with \texttt{make test}.\\
            Remember, that this requires UVVM to be built once (\texttt{make uvvm}) and the DUV to be built (\texttt{make ip}) each time you changed the DUVs' RTL.

      \item Your test sequence should run successfully and output logs to the command line. Look at these logs, to evaluate your test sequence.
\end{enumerate}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Realize the similarity between the different interfaces}

At this point, we have two working test sequences for the memory. One that uses an AXI interface, and another that uses an Avalon MM interface.\\
\\
By comparing the two test sequences, we realize, that they are pretty much the exact same code. This is a major advantage of using VVCs. Imagine the following situation. We have a working DUV, that has an AXI interface. For some reason, the designer decides to swap it against an Avalon MM bus. In a simple ``selfmade'' testbench, this would require a major code change. However, in our UVVM verification environment, this simply means to switch out the VVC component, re-wire the bus signals in a single place in code, and rename the VVC functions (e.g. \texttt{axilite\_write()} to \texttt{avalon\_mm\_write()}).

\subsubsection{(optional) The scoreboard}

The UVVM scoreboard is a useful tool to acquire some statistical data with test sequences.

\begin{enumerate}
      \item Open the \href{../../example-tb/src/tb/sequences/av\_mm\_reg\_seq\_pkg.vhd} {Avalon MM test sequence file}\footnote{example-tb/src/tb/sequences/av\_mm\_reg\_seq\_pkg.vhd}.
      \item Scroll to the write-read test section.
      \item Familiarize with the scoreboard functions that are used.
      \item Run \texttt{make test} and find the log output that was produced by the \texttt{scoreboard.report\_counters()} function.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{(optional) Write a LED test sequence}

The DUV acts as a driver to an array of eight LEDs. The respective value the LEDs display are a representation of the \texttt{LED\_CONTROL} register.\\
\\
To verify the correct functionality of this LED driver part, we will implement an extension to the AXI test sequence we previously worked on.

\begin{enumerate}
      \item Open the \href{../../example-tb/src/tb/blinkylight\_th.vhd} {test harness file}\footnote{example-tb/src/tb/blinkylight\_th.vhd}.
      \item Scroll to the ``instantiations'' section of the file, where you will find a GPIO VVC that is already instantiated and hooked up to the LED output of the DUV.
      \item Open the \href{../../example-tb/src/tb/sequences/axi\_reg\_seq\_pkg.vhd} {AXI register test sequence file}\footnote{example-tb/src/tb/sequences/axi\_reg\_seq\_pkg.vhd}, which we already know from a previous task in the tutorial.
      \item In the existing test sequence, there is a part that sets a value to the \texttt{LED\_CONTROL} register and reads back its value, to verify the register access. However, this does not verify that the value was actually routed through all the way to the LED output. Let's verify that.
      \item Use the GPIO VVC to check the value of the LED output.\\
            \\
            Each UVVM VVC is provided along with documentation. Open the \href{../../UVVM/bitvis\_vip\_gpio/doc/gpio\_vvc\_QuickRef.pdf} {documentation for the GPIO VVC}\footnote{UVVM/bitvis\_vip\_gpio/doc/gpio\_vvc\_QuickRef.pdf} to see which functions are available.\\
            \\
            \underline{A little hint:}\\
            Use the \texttt{gpio\_expect(VVCT, vvc\_instance\_idx, data\_exp, timeout, msg)} function.
      \item Run \texttt{make test} to run the test sequence.

\end{enumerate}
